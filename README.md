This repository contains the source code for a 3D concrete printing optimization tool, which combines Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and generative design techniques. Additionally, it includes a user-friendly dashboard for navigating the design space. This tool is designed to aid engineers and designers in optimizing 3D-printed concrete structures.
