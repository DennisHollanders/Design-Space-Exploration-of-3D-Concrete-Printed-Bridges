This code is examplary for importing the relevant libraries into the rhinocode module.
You can also browse to find the correct folder within rhino
and copy your environment in there. At the time of writing the method below works
a bit buggy, running it multiple times/opening/closing the laptop could make it eventually work.

# There is something wrong with loading the pandas library this code should fix it. It is a known problem discussed on the developers page so it might be irrelevant at time of reading. The import Locale method should resolve this 

# Below an example of the code to be ran to install libraries to the RhinoCode environment
Example:

The code to import:
import locale
locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, 'en_US')


# requirements: pandas,scipy, numpy
# r: pandas == 2.0.3,scipy==1.11.1, numpy==1.25.1
